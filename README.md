## üéØ Purpose & Introduction

**Argus** is an open-source library dedicated to advancing the field of **few-shot counting**. Inspired by the all-seeing hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology, Argus provides a unified framework and toolkit for developers and researchers to build, evaluate, and deploy models that can count objects in images after seeing just a few examples.

Counting objects in images is a fundamental vision task. However, traditional counting methods often require massive amounts of labeled data for each new object type or scenario, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire. Few-shot counting solves this by enabling models to learn to count novel categories from only a handful of annotated examples.

The goal of **Argus** is to:
*   **Democratize Access**: Make state-of-the-art few-shot counting algorithms accessible to everyone with a simple `pip install`.
*   **Provide a Fair Playground**: Offer a standardized framework for training and evaluating models on common benchmarks (e.g., FSC-147) to ensure fair and consistent comparisons.
*   **Foster Innovation**: Accelerate research and application by allowing easy experimentation, combination, and benchmarking of different model architectures and ideas.
*   **Simplify Deployment**: Provide tools to easily take models from research to production in various environments.

Whether you're a researcher exploring new algorithms, a developer building an application that needs to count cells, vehicles, or animals, or a student learning about computer vision, Argus is designed to be your comprehensive starting point.
